All the training code, testing result and visualization could be found in train.ipynb.

For the original training, we used different jupyter notebook, the original results could be found in different notebooks respectively. But we train the same model with different learning rate in one document, so some of the records may be lost. But all models have been saved in .pth files.

To run training, pip install all the required packets and download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data, unzip the dataset into this folder and run train.ipynb. Note that the baselines and our model have different training process.
